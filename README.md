# REST APIS

## What are APIs?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your **request** to the provider that youâ€™re requesting it from and then delivers the **response** back to you.

### Types of APIs

APIs are classified broadly based on the types of interactions they allow to make, for instance if you want to interact with hardware a hardware API could be used. These are some of the major classifications:

- Web Service APIs
- WebSocket APIs
- Library based APIs
- Class-based APIs
- OS functions and routines
- Object remoting APIs
- Hardware APIs

## Web Service APIs

An API which provides access to its service via a **URL**. Requests are made to a server, the server then processes the information in the request and sends back a response.

### Uses of web service APIs

### Different types

- SOAP
- XML-RPC and JSON-RPC
- REST (becoming more used in modern times, easy to use)

## Different types of REST requests

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

## How to call REST APIs

### Postman

<div class="postman-run-button"
data-postman-action="collection/import"
data-postman-var-1="cc484222507702a2970e"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) {
    !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); });
    !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild((
      (n = o.createElement("script")),
      (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n
    ));
  }(window, document, "_pm", "PostmanRunObject", "https://run.pstmn.io/button.js"));
</script>
